# Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship program and focuses on building a **binary classifier** using **Logistic Regression** with the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

---

##  Objective

To build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression, evaluate its performance, and understand key concepts like the sigmoid function and threshold tuning.

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

##  Summary

- The model was trained using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Feature scaling was applied using `StandardScaler`.
- Evaluation was done using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and other metrics.
- Custom threshold tuning was also explored.
- Sigmoid function behavior was visualized.
